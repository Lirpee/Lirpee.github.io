<h1>Overview</h1>
<strong><p>Pros</p></strong>
<p>Good combo potential. (C move is extremely good for slowing down enemies)</p>
<p>In Transformation, the C move has one of the biggest hitboxes in the game, similar to Awakened Buddha V.</p>
<p>Gains 62.5% Damage resistance against attacks in Dragon form stacks with Aura.</p>
<p>Good in PvP.</p>
<p>Holding C can make the move last longer.</p>
<p>Not hard to aim, especially in dragon form, due to the fact of its enormous hitbox.</p>
<p>Good mobility.</p>
<p>Good damage.</p>
<p>X move has burn damage, which is useful in PvP.</p>
<p>High knockback (Z being able to knock enemies away, X being able to lock target)</p>
<p>Dragon is useful in ground PvP.</p>
<p>Decent for grinding in the Third Sea.</p>


<strong><p>Cons</p></strong>
<p>2nd most expensive fruit in game (Which also means its rarity is high)</p>
<p>Not recommended for low level users. (Especially in 1st sea in which the fruit will be almost useless until the player unlocks Dragonic Claw, even if you get it itâ€™s not really good for grinding)</p>
<p>High mastery required.</p>
<p>While in Transformation, you become a bigger target, just like Buddha transformation.</p>
<p>Not recommended in Ranged PvP.</p>
<p>Takes over a minute to fully regain Fury Meter. (Can be sped up by using skills)</p>
<p>X move (untransformed) is hard to hit.</p>
<p>X move is single target. (untransformed)</p>
<p>C move in transformed during its charge up and its recovery after use is punishable.</p>
<p>C requires certain aiming skills. Best to use this as a ground attack. Not recommended for sky pvp.</p>
<p>C in transformed form only fires below you, and cannot be controlled by the cursor.</p>
<p>Cursed Dual Katana X ignores the damage reduction of transform dragon.</p>
<p>Bad for grinding, Skills have some knockbacks. Only 2 multiple targets moves but have low cool down. X move is great for boss grind because it does good stun and damage though. (untransformed)</p>
