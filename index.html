<p>Decent for grinding in the Third Sea.</p>


<strong><p>Cons</p></strong>
<p>2nd most expensive fruit in game (Which also means its rarity is high)</p>
<p>Not recommended for low level users. (Especially in 1st sea in which the fruit will be almost useless until the player unlocks Dragonic Claw, even if you get it it’s not really good for grinding)</p>
<p>High mastery required.</p>
<p>While in Transformation, you become a bigger target, just like Buddha transformation.</p>
<p>Not recommended in Ranged PvP.</p>
<p>Takes over a minute to fully regain Fury Meter. (Can be sped up by using skills)</p>
<p>X move (untransformed) is hard to hit.</p>
<p>X move is single target. (untransformed)</p>
<p>C move in transformed during its charge up and its recovery after use is punishable.</p>
<p>C requires certain aiming skills. Best to use this as a ground attack. Not recommended for sky pvp.</p>
<p>C in transformed form only fires below you, and cannot be controlled by the cursor.</p>
<p>Cursed Dual Katana X ignores the damage reduction of transform dragon.</p>
<p>Bad for grinding, Skills have some knockbacks. Only 2 multiple targets moves but have low cool down. X move is great for boss grind because it does good stun and damage though. (untransformed)</p>
